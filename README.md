### Printing

The ```Print``` command saves the current music sheet as HTML file and opens it in your default browser for printing. We suggest Google Chrome for best results.

### Snippets

There are some snippets included to generate ABC code for you. Just type ```abc-``` in your ABC file and select a snippet.
